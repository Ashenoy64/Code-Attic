# Code Attic

Code Attic is a repository that serves as a collection of various code snippets, scripts, and small projects. This repository acts as a digital attic where I keep my coding experiments, tests, assignments, and fun coding projects. It is a personal archive of all the coding adventures I have embarked on, from simple algorithms to applications.

## Purpose

The main purpose of Code Attic is to store and organize my coding journey and the creative process behind different coding endeavors. It is a place to preserve the various codes I have tried for testing, learning, and just for fun. Please note that the codes in this collection might vary in quality, may have bugs, or might not be fully functional. The focus here is on exploration and learning rather than production-ready code.

## Usage

Code Attic is primarily a personal collection, but if you come across this repository and find anything useful or interesting, you are more than welcome to explore, learn from, and even use the codes here. However, keep in mind that these codes might not be optimized or thoroughly tested for production use.
